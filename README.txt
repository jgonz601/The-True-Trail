There's a bug in the first level where if you die and use the restart function, the game
won't let you advance to the next level. Due to lost code, I couldn't fix it.
If you end up getting this bug just close the game and open it again.

The third level, while finished, it was rushed thus it's lower quality and might contain more bugs.
